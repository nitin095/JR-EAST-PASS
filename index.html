                                Over 500 years ago, Ginzan Onsen was a prosperous silver mine. These days, its original
                                ryokan hotels and their wood and white plaster walls, public hot spring spas and little
                                bridges over the Ginzan River make this town a must-see. During winter days, snow-clad
                                roofs and narrow streets by the river are easy on the eye, but at night, with the gas
                                lamps lit, Ginzan Onsen turns into a Japanese fairytale.

                        Nagano’s natural beauty is never more striking than during winter. Snow monkeys escaping the

                        sweet dried persimmon brings smiles to cold faces.

                                - soba noodles from Togakushi, Nagano City - are literally a law to themselves. This
                                dish is so traditional and part of Nagano’s culture, there are rules about how it’s
                                served, eaten, and even what condiments and sides it has. It seems all buckwheat noodles
                                are soba noodles, but not all soba noodles are Togakushi soba!

                                the abundance of seafood makes for incredible eating in Niigata. Rosy sea bass, spear
